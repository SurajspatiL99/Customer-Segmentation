## Introduction:
The objective of this project was to perform customer segmentation and clustering using Python, focusing on univariate and bivariate analysis. The K-means clustering algorithm was employed for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate segmentation and clustering. The goal was to identify trends, patterns, and similarities among customers, providing valuable insights for business decision-making.

## Methodology:

Data Preprocessing: The customer dataset was preprocessed using Python's data analysis libraries, such as Pandas and NumPy. Data cleaning techniques were applied to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data quality.

Univariate and Bivariate Analysis: Extensive univariate and bivariate analysis techniques were employed to understand the distribution, relationships, and correlations between variables in the customer dataset. Descriptive statistics and visualization techniques were used to identify trends and patterns.

Feature Engineering: Feature engineering was performed to extract meaningful features from the dataset, enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of the clustering process. Relevant variables were selected, and new features were derived based on domain knowledge and business requirements.

K-means Clustering Algorithm: The K-means algorithm was implemented in Python to perform customer segmentation and clustering. Initially, univariate clustering was conducted to group customers based on individual variables. Subsequently, bivariate and multivariate clustering were performed to explore relationships between pairs and combinations of variables.


## Results:

Identified Trends and Patterns: Through univariate and bivariate analysis, several trends and patterns were uncovered within the customer dataset. This included correlations between variables, distribution characteristics, and significant features that influence customer behavior.

Customer Segmentation: The K-means clustering algorithm successfully segmented customers into distinct groups based on their similarities and differences. Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clustering facilitated a comprehensive understanding of customer segments.

Insights for Decision-Making: The segmentation and clustering results provided valuable insights for business decision-making. It enabled targeted marketing strategies, personalized customer experiences, and optimization of resource allocation based on the characteristics and preferences of each customer segment.

## Conclusion:
In conclusion, this project successfully employed Python for customer segmentation and clustering using univariate and bivariate analysis. The K-means clustering algorithm proved to be effective for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate clustering. The project provided actionable insights by identifying trends, patterns, and distinct customer segments, enabling data-driven decision-making and enhancing business strategies.
